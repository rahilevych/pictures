# 🖼️ pictures
This project was built to familiarize myself with Firebase and deepen my knowledge of React.js. The website is fully responsive and allows users to search for images via the Pixabay API.

## 🗃️ Technologies
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Firebase
- SASS
- Context API

## 🤙 Features
The website provides different features for registered and unregistered users.

### Unregistered users can:
- Browse the list of images
- Search for images
- Read comments from other users
- Register a new account
### Registered users can do everything unregistered users can, plus:
- Manage a wishlist: add or remove images from the saved list
- Add and delete comments: share reviews and feedback on images
- 
## 📽️ Development Process
The project started with planning the main features. After that, I deepened my knowledge of Firebase by studying its documentation. The project was then divided into pages, which were further broken down into reusable components. Some components communicated via props, while others used the Context API for state management. For styling, I utilized the SASS preprocessor.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Advanced React.js skills
- Improved understanding of the Context API
- Enhanced TypeScript proficiency
